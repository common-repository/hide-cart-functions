Hide the product's price, add to cart button, quantity, and options on any product and order. Inject an optional message.

== Description ==

Several plugins provide a means to edit the shopping page cart functions, to hide the price, "Add to Cart" button, quantity selector, and the product options dropdown, but not all in one plugin. Additionally, none of the available plugins or snippets allow a custom message to appear in any format including embedded graphics, nor do they allow any combination of hidden shopping cart elements on the same WooCommerce website.

At least not until now! <strong>Hide Cart Functions</strong> simply gives a WooCommerce website full control over each user side shop's function, while at the same time allowing a user to create several rules to apply to various categories or products within the same system. 

Take your shopping page edits one step further, a user can also enter IDs or classes to hide custom elements. This extra provision provides a means for users to customize third-party plugin functions that are additional to WooCommerce options or adjust those provided by themes with WooCommerce templates. This additional level of customization may come with unexpected results, therefore use at your own discretion followed by a good deal of testing. We cannot resolve any conflicts resulting in the use of this field.

As of <strong>version 1.0.4</strong>, a requested setting has been added to each rule, that allows you to apply the rule to Guest Users only or Logged-In users only, but doesn't allow both at once which would cause a conflict. Leave both unchecked to apply to all users.

As of <strong>version 1.0.5</strong>, search and select for products with a 3 letter minimum was added to ease the selection of products to the rule applies. This addition works in combination with the Product ID field, meaning you can use one or the other or both at once.

<strong>How to Find a Product ID:</strong> Open your WordPress dashboard and click on Pages > All Pages. Then, select the page that you need to find the ID for. Once the page has opened, you need to look at the URL in your web browserâ€™s address bar. Here, you will find the page ID number displayed within the page URL, immediately behind ?post=.

<strong>Plugin Limitation:</strong> As a disclaimer to this plugin's capabilities, it is not possible to create a rule to customize the cart functions for any individual Variable Post ID found within a variable product post. The plugin can only modify the functions of a Product ID or Category ID due to the limits inherent in WooCommerce itself, not for lack of the plugin.

The plugin supports languages including English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Russian.
